- OpenBIOS (http://www.openbios.org/) is a free (GPL v2) portable
  firmware implementation. The goal is to implement a 100% IEEE
  1275-1994 (referred to as Open Firmware) compliant firmware.

- The S390 zipl loader is an addition to the official IBM s390-tools
  package. That fork is maintained in its own git repository at:
  git://repo.or.cz/s390-tools.git

- These PXE ROMs come from the Joyent fork of iPXE[1]:

    virtio 1af4:1000

  The ROMs are built via sdcboot.git[2] with a few customisations:

  - BANNER_TIMEOUT is set to 0, for the quickest possible boot time
  - PRODUCT_NAME is set to "SmartOS HVM"
  - COMCONSOLE is set to COM1, as COM2 is for metadata in SmartOS

  Once the customisations are applied, each ROM is built like so,
  substituting for the appropriate vendor/product ID:

    gmake -j32 ipxe/src/bin/1af41000.rom
